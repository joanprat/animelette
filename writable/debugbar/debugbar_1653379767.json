Well, not quite. This genre has a shtick for being oversaturated, particularly with many poor productions. Why should you watch Sakurasou in particular, over the many other rom-com slice of life s? Well, read on to find out.\n\n    Sakurasou does one thing especially well that makes it stand out among its competitors, and that is its character dynamics. That is an aspect of it that is simply fantastic. As such, this review contains a fairly lengthy discussion of the plot, which I will highlight with spoiler tags.\n\n    The main characters of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo are Kanda Sorata, Kamiigusa Misaki, Shiina Mashiro, Aoyama Nanami and Mitaka Jin. Already, Sakurasou can be seen as a highly unique anime. With 5 characters that are all equally important to the story, the audience gets five times the character development than most rom-coms. However, the story technically follows the adventures of Kanda Sorata, who has been banished to Sakurasou (&#8220;Sakura Hall&#8221;) due to the regular school dorms not allowing the keeping of cats. As he cares deeply for his cats, Kanda ends up biting the bullet and chooses to live at Sakurasou. There at Sakurasou, he lives with other would-be delinquents. And so, the relationships between the five characters at Sakurasou would serve as the backbone of this anime s story.\n\n    Presumably, this should already be heaven for any rom-com slice of life lover; after all, there are five main characters and 24 episodes. The real thing that does it for Sakurasou, however, is the romance aspect of the anime. And by &#8220;doing it&#8221;, I mean doing a disservice. The romance in this anime is quite horrid, honestly. This is especially hard for me to say as I thoroughly enjoyed literally every single aspect of Sakurasou, except for its romance.\n\n    I m going to be discussing the story in mild detail, so if you don t want to be spoiled at all, skip to the [endspoiler] tag.\n\n\n\n    **[startspoiler]\n\n\n\n    My first problem is Misaki s relationship with Jin. Due to the nature of the anime and the nature of Misaki s personality itself, her quest for love was simply a joke; I never really took it seriously. Whenever she cried after her numerous failures, I did not feel sympathy for her, nor did I feel emotional as a viewer. Misaki s love struggles never really had any weight to them, and they even got resolved fairly quickly (as if to further undermine them).\n\n    The other problem: Aoyama and Kanda s relationship. Oh boy. This relationship single-handedly &#8220;ruined&#8221; Sakurasou for me (not really ruined, but it basically kicked my pairing hopes in the nutsack). I personally rooted for Aoyama and Kanda to get together throughout the series, but man was THAT wishful thinking. Before watching this series, I read many posts touting Sakurasou as being &#8220;the bad kind of predictable&#8221;. And I certainly see why now. Right from the first episode, you could already see Shiina x Kanda being established. Them getting all touchy-feely so early on, the sexual innuendos, the peeping moments&#8230; it was all meant to be from the very beginning. So why then, did the writers decide to create a second relationship branch in Aoyama x Kanda? It makes zero sense to me, and Sakurasou s execution of the pairing itself made just about the same amount of sense. The entire time, Kanda is as blunt as a block while Aoyama is as pitiful as a bug. It was just painful for me to watch Aoyama each time she tried to confess to Kanda. Her constant failures were just really disgusting, and especially so since I m one of the viewers who prefer Aoyama over Shiina. Not by much, because I do love Shiina as a character, but some preference nonetheless. Aoyama s unrealized love was truly cringe-worthy; two especially disgusting moments were when she confesses her love, only to play it off as &#8220;good acting&#8221;, and when she gave a half-ass confession to Kanda after her audition. Seriously, it s like the producers were purposely getting my hopes up simply to laugh at me afterwards. Two times, we were supposed to get Aoyama to finally confess to Kanda, and for Kanda to (more than likely) go out with her or reject her. But, we get the worse-case scenario; Aoyama s love is never realized! As I have said before, the chemistry between Aoyama and Kanda really pissed me off not only due to how poorly it was coordinated but also by how unnecessary it was. The producers did NOT need to include a second girl for Kanda; this isn t a harem anime. Shiina would have been good enough, and the story could have simply focused on Kanda x Shiina being realized. However, just as this anime put the final nail in the coffin when it came to pissing me off with Aoyama x Kanda, episode 23 came about: the graduation episode. And boy, let me tell you. This was one of the greatest episodes in anime history; I m just going to say it now. The emotion displayed in this episode by all the characters (students, school staff members, Sakurasou residents included) was simply unreal. This scene does not necessarily make you want to cry. However, you can sense the genuineness within each characters  sadness, their speeches, and their feelings for each other. Instead of being a giant cheesefest, the producers of Sakurasou actually managed to make the graduation episode an honest-to-goodness emotional episode. And I felt it. However, I found myself asking: 'Why wasn t this the final episode?'\n\n    The last episode (24) made it seem as if there was still plenty more for Sakurasou to cover. It introduced two new characters, and it was the start of a new year; everything was fresh. We were going to see Kanda and Shiina being isolated from the other main characters for the first time, and maybe even having their relationship furthered. We even got a glimpse of the two new members of Sakurasou, and they are not bad characters in the slightest. All in all, the producers had quite a lot of quality material to work with if they wanted to create another season. So why didn t they? After I finished watching all 24 episodes of Sakurasou, I was left wanting more. The series didn t really &#8220;end&#8221; at all; why start a new chapter if you re just going to cut it off right away? The ending makes no sense to me. You could say that this is a sign that the producers are thinking of a second season, but there hasn t really been any news yet. It s just wishful thinking as of now.\n\n\n\n    **[endspoiler]\n\n\n\n    In every other department, however, Sakurasou excels.\n\n    Story [9\/10]: Probably the most important aspect of an anime, Sakurasou has an exceptional story. While its romance is admittedly weak, as previously discussed, it doesn t take much away from the story. There were quite a lot of aspects of Sakurasou that I had a critique for, and yet I found myself excitedly watching every episode regardless. I constantly wanted to find out what would happen next, and I was definitely held in suspense during many moments throughout the anime. The moments of drama, in particular, gave Sakurasou such great depth.\n\n    Art [10\/10]: One of the absolute KILLER aspects of Sakurasou! The art implements a fairly unique style, using mainly warm and bright colors. Most animes have art that uses colors and shades from a generic palette, which causes them to look to look very similar to each other; Sakurasou strays away from this. All of the characters are drawn nicely, along with all of the minute details in the animations being perfectly executed. However, if there was one thing to really set Sakurasou apart, it s the art used to portray Shiina Mashiro s artistic virtuosity. As the viewer, I was able to completely comprehend the extent of Shiina s skill due to Sakurasou s magnificent art. Not to mention, whoever drew Shiina s drawings was quite talented themselves.\n\n    Sound [10\/10]: The only proof I need to verify the greatness of Sakurasou s soundtrack is the fact that its OPs\/EDs are among my top-played songs on my iPod. Initially, I wasn t really feeling the first opening; it sounded somewhat generic. However, after listening to it multiple times by virtue of watching the anime, I fell in love with it. The openings completely portray the mood of the entire anime (and the openings very cleverly display the fantastic art style, too). The second ending in particular went very nicely with the characters dynamics at that point in the story.\n\n    Character [10\/10]: Sakurasou s characters truly give it that extra dimension. For a rom-com, all five main characters are surprisingly deep. Throughout the story, we get to learn of all of their backgrounds. What makes them so amazing is the fact that despite vastly contrasting upbringings, all of the Sakurasou residents are accepting of each other. There is never any sense of dislike or resentment among them, and they are all genuine friends. That chemistry between them is what makes them so special to watch.\n\n\n    I thought long and hard about my final rating. Admittedly, there are quite a few problems with Sakurasou, such as its romance. However, for an anime that has left such a huge impact on me, Sakurasou deserves nothing less than a perfect score. Along with other viewers, I have been left wanting more. Few other animes have managed to make me feel this way. And while I was watching it, Sakurasou provided countless laughs and a fair share of quality drama. Never was I bored at any moment while watching the series. The greatest thing about Sakurasou, however, is the fact that it manages to meet and then exceed the standard expectations of a romantic comedy slice-of-life anime; it truly is a fantastic production. Rarely can anyone recommend an anime of this genre as a must-watch for anime enthusiasts of all kinds, but that is exactly what I m doing with Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo.\n<\/pre><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idReview<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"1\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[0]['idReview']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>date<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (12) \"Jul 22, 2016\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[0]['date']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>likes<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (2) \"13\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[0]['likes']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt class=\"kint-parent\"><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><span class=\"kint-popup-trigger\" title=\"Open in new window\">&boxbox;<\/span><nav><\/nav><dfn>1<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>array<\/var> (11)<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]<\/div><\/dt><dd><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idUser<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"2\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['idUser']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>username<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (4) \"iPig\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['username']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>profilePic<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (12) \"ipig_pfp.png\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['profilePic']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>engagement<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (3) \"275\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['engagement']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idAnime<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (2) \"14\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['idAnime']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>nameJap<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (6) \"K-On!!\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['nameJap']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>banner<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (16) \"k-on2_banner.jpg\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['banner']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt class=\"kint-parent\"><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><span class=\"kint-popup-trigger\" title=\"Open in new window\">&boxbox;<\/span><nav><\/nav><dfn>content<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (3343) \"Every day is a blast at the Light Music Club.

All the memories of happiness and feelings fill up a treasure box. The lasting days in the lives of the K-On!! girls is a golden collection asking to be embraced. And I will embrace them. Always.\n\n    While I absolutely adored the cake eating and lazing around aspect in the first season, this season takes a solid shift and presents the series into a great slice-of-life. It isn't limited to their club room only, and these five cute stars embark on a branching set of activities from school trips to concerts where they interact adorably with precious friendship. No matter where they are, there's never a dull moment with them around. Just look at the cuteception. They're even self-aware of their own cuteness! These characters have a special quality to them other than their entertaining personalities. From the family bond as sisters or the relationship they have with their teacher, an aura is formed where every soul who stumbles upon it will form an attachment. So, as graduation is nearing, the club members have to realize that they must move on with the next stage of their life. And to move along with a strong friendship that will last for eternity. All the fun times and the silly times they had, these are the memories that hold the evidence that their bonds are true. That closeness, which is formed in the realm of simple day-to-day interactions, is a purity that describes a genuine friendship. Every moments are meaningful. Every moments activate my attachment. Every time, they never fail to place a smile on my face.\n\n    Under the windows of their treasured club room, the rays of a warm and setting afternoon light glazes over the best friends. Backed up by a soothing melody, they cherish the time they have spent together after a spectacular run of their last ever high school performance. This is a heartwarming scene and if not for the audiovisual talents from Kyoto Animation, it wouldn't have become such a special scene that permeated with joyous and sad emotions. The amount of efforts put in by them is something that I appreciate. The visual captures all kinds of tone hanging in the air. Those googly eyes that gaze all the way through my kokoro switch on my affectionate side. The energy-driven animation expresses the character's personality without the need for narrative techniques effectively. And then there is the soft lighting that speaks on so many levels, mostly to radiate positivity. All these made the small moments into something more meaningful, because there are some fine feelings hidden beneath the realistic colors. Another aspect behind the visual is in the sound and their relaxing sensation can be felt without disturbing the lighthearted interactions of the characters. Each one of the seiyuus act out their roles with a cute tone. Performed by them as well, the songs played during the club performance are fun to listen to. Some of the songs also embody a deeper meaning in the lyrics so hearing these filled me up with even more emotions as they perform together as a close group.\n\n    K-On!! is an anime for U&amp;I. Every time I watch an episode, I know that I will no doubt feel happiness. And I'm sure you too can feel that same happiness. We all can become a piece of this memory and preserve it. Wouldn't that be the perfect treasure?\n<\/pre><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idReview<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"5\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['idReview']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>date<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (12) \"Nov 27, 2018\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['date']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>likes<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (2) \"10\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[1]['likes']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt class=\"kint-parent\"><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><span class=\"kint-popup-trigger\" title=\"Open in new window\">&boxbox;<\/span><nav><\/nav><dfn>2<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>array<\/var> (11)<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]<\/div><\/dt><dd><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idUser<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"1\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['idUser']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>username<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (7) \"HikariP\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['username']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>profilePic<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (15) \"hikarip_pfp.png\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['profilePic']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>engagement<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (3) \"121\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['engagement']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idAnime<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"9\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['idAnime']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>nameJap<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (29) \"Kimetsu no Yaiba: Yuukaku-hen\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['nameJap']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>banner<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (25) \"kimetsuyuukaku_banner.jpg\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['banner']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt class=\"kint-parent\"><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><span class=\"kint-popup-trigger\" title=\"Open in new window\">&boxbox;<\/span><nav><\/nav><dfn>content<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (8334) \"First review!

Totally gonna get lost under the sea of demon slayer reviews from fanboys and haters alike now that s2 is over but oh well. I love this show a lot, but I recognize that there are a lot of problems with it that can get in the way of others enjoying it. Here I  ll try to break down this season, compare it to the previous one, and talk about why I really enjoyed it as best I can with my amateur writing skills.\n\n    Characters: Better!\n\n    One of the weaker elements in the first season was the characters, and while this season doesn  t change the game entirely in that department it does get a bit better. Zenitsu and Inosuke are actually cool more consistently and less annoying overall. Tanjiro is still just as pure and kindhearted. The Rengoku arc was wrapped up nicely and we get some closure with his asshat of a Dad which is nice, and probably the best you  re gonna get from Demon Slayer in terms of character writing.\n\n    Uzui Tengen, the new Hashira introduced, is great. He  s cool, full of personality and loads of fun to watch on-screen. I didn  t have much of an attachment to Rengoku, and Tengen completely blows him out of the water in terms of enjoyability. His interactions and dynamic with his three(! what a chad) wives are fun and cute and I  m glad they didn  t shoehorn in a half-assed, predictable and boring 'polygamy bad &gt;:(' storyline.\n\n    The wives themselves are pretty one-note but they  re entertaining enough to watch. The demons are cool but not because of the character writing, the obligatory human backstory given at the end was pretty generic and boring and didn  t do much for me.\n\n    Demon Slayer  s characters were never gonna win any awards and I totally get finding them totally boring or unenjoyable, but I personally think they do the job perfectly fine and are quite fun to watch.\n\n    A big part of the show that seems to be one of the biggest reasons people don  t like it is, of course, the childish humor. It was there in season one, it was there in Mugen Train, and its here in Entertainment District. Sometimes its funny, most of the time its obnoxious, but I  d still rather it be here than not.\n\n    As a comparison, another show that, like Demon Slayer, has meh writing but good animation made by ufotable is Katsugeki Touken Ranbu. But I love Demon Slayer and dropped Katsugeki after two episodes, and one is the biggest thing in Japan while the other is practically unheard of. Why? Because Katsugeki was boring as shit. Demon Slayer at least has personality. It has style and flair. Sure, its a divisive personality that not everyone  s gonna love, but it at least has one. I  d rather a show have some childish moments backed by great animation than just a load of boring uninspired nothing backed with great animation; at least its not boring.\n\n    But I guess that brings me to another issue with this season specifically, that it can  t decide whether its target audience is 8 year olds or 16 year olds. Childish humor can be somewhat charming in a cringy, goofy way. Big titty thick thighed ninja wives with a lot of exposed skin and a sexy prostitute demon can be enjoyable in a guilty-pleasure sort of way. But if you  re flipping between the two every 5 minutes than it becomes a little jarring.\n\n    Like as I  m watching the first half of it I imagine a Japanese family watching this season, with middle aged salaryman parents and 2 kids, one in high school and one in elementary school and it switches back and forth between half naked women fighting and Zenitsu crying his eyes out after getting bullied by Inosuke and it just seems like no one in this family is having a good time. Taking darker, sexier and more adult themes and wrapping it in eight-year old jokes just feels a bit weird. Thankfully that problem goes away near the second half as the show becomes a 2 hour long rollercoaster of a fight scene stretched over several episodes\n\n    Animation: Even Better\n    Fights in General: Less Good\n\n    Despite ufotable somehow managing to step up their animation game even more, the fights other than the climax felt less impactful and realistic. The animation is consistently flashier and more dynamic, and while sometimes CG models stand out as a bit strange looking for the most part they look flawless. The biggest problem with this season  s fights is the power scaling. Tanjiro  s HInokami Kagura that he uses only once in the biggest moments of season one and Mugen Train he now uses again, and again, and again,\n\n    and again,\n\n    and I get that that  s demonstrating how much stronger he  s getting over time but it just doesn  t feel as impactful anymore. He keeps getting his ass beat to the point where he should  ve died already but nope, don  t worry he can just set his heart ablaze and pull another Hinokami out of his ass again, but this time even stronger! This isn  t even the worst offender:\n\n\n    and yeah its goofy as hell that they can get every bone in their body shattered and fix it by 'Recovery Breathing!'\n\n    The Climax\n\n    Up until now, this review has been largely negative, but I still enjoyed the show immensely. Even without the unbelievable moments this show brings, even if it wasn  t blessed by ufotable  s godlike grace it would still be an enjoyable 7, maybe 8\/10 from me because there  s still good fun to be had here.\n\n    But the reason I keep coming back to this show, why Demon Slayer will always be one of my favorites, is that one moment. After entire episodes of action, twists and turns and shocks and hype, all just a prelude to that one moment, where everything leading up to it, the music, the rising tension, the entirety of ufotable  s Unlimited Budget Works, all of it comes together into the one, incredible, breathtaking moment, and\n\n    leaves you in awe.\n\n    Season one had episode 19. Mugen Train didn  t have that moment for me. The entire time I was watching this season, through all the rest of the hype and rediculous animation, I was waiting for that one moment to come.\n\n    And then episode 10 hits, and everything was worth it.\n\n    The final fight was just as incredible as Episode 19, but for completely different reasons. Episode 19 is a beautiful, elegant and serene 2-person dance accompanied by soft, intimate music. The visuals are bright with broad strokes of fire over a background of darkness, and watching it felt like looking at an oil painting in motion. Episode 10 of Entertainment District is a raging, chaotic, messy brawl filled with screaming, explosions, blinding fast attacks, and bright, sharp slashes of clanging blades with a dark, moody and extravagant symphony roaring over the action. This isn  t a vibrant renaissance oil painting, it  s a crazy dude with paintbrushes throwing paint onto a canvas as hard as he can. And it  s gorgeous.\n\n    Everything about Episode 10 just worked. It  s one of those episodes I can go back months from now and rewatch again and again and again, my jaw dropping onto the floor just as hard each time. It  s moments like this that make me go, 'Holy Fuck I love anime so god damn much.' Because months and years in the future, when I look back on Demon Slayer, it  s not the weak writing I remember or the plot holes or Zenitsu and Inosuke being annoying. It  s moments like this. It  s Season One Episode 19 and Entertainment District Arc Episode 10, the moments that are immortal.\n\n    Some people resentfully say that these moments are wasted on what they see as an otherwise unremarkable show, and would be much better utilized in some other show with higher quality writing or characters. While I won  t dispute that claim, I will say that I for one am perfectly content with the fact we got these moments at all.\n\n    Conclusion\n\n    Despite being the biggest thing in Japan, the highest grossing anime film of all time, and one of the most popular anime internationally, Demon Slayer is not for everyone. I wouldn  t recommend it to friends who don  t watch anime. I hold no grudge against anyone who can  t forgive its flaws or hates the characters or thinks it  s overrated garbage because yeah, it totally makes sense why you would think that. But I for one had a great time watching everything this show has to offer and I  m excited to see more. Even if it means waiting another 2 fucking years.\n<\/pre><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idReview<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"2\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['idReview']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>date<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (12) \"Feb 01, 2022\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['date']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>likes<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"1\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[2]['likes']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt class=\"kint-parent\"><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><span class=\"kint-popup-trigger\" title=\"Open in new window\">&boxbox;<\/span><nav><\/nav><dfn>3<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>array<\/var> (11)<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]<\/div><\/dt><dd><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idUser<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"1\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['idUser']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>username<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (7) \"HikariP\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['username']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>profilePic<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (15) \"hikarip_pfp.png\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['profilePic']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>engagement<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (3) \"121\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['engagement']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idAnime<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"3\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['idAnime']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>nameJap<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (28) \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['nameJap']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>banner<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (26) \"danshikoukousei_banner.jpg\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['banner']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt class=\"kint-parent\"><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><span class=\"kint-popup-trigger\" title=\"Open in new window\">&boxbox;<\/span><nav><\/nav><dfn>content<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (3086) \"Jokes, Comedy, Humour (essentially whatever you wanna call the haha's) So, t...<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['content']<\/div><\/dt><dd><pre>Jokes, Comedy, Humour (essentially whatever you wanna call the haha's)\n    So, these are the exact reason why i give this series a 10. It's a gag manga through and through, and doesn't try to overplay itself or stretch itself too thin. The author uses a few pages of chuckle-worthy lines before giving you a punchline that makes you belly laugh. Wether it's the boys getting bored in school, or going to the beach to try and get some 'female attention', the jokes always land at the right time and make me laugh pretty much every time. The key thing with these jokes is that they are NOT deep and dark humour, they're stupid puns and slapstick jokes. An example would be the boys getting bored and attempting to find a way to cure their boredom in school. We see Hidenori and Tanaka in the playground, before attempting to play catch with something. We see them try and ball up and throw their blazers, leading to an on-running joke of them not understanding that the force will break the bundle of jacket apart. This is then followed by them playing catch with one of their shoes. As they go to throw the shoe, it proceeds to get stuck in the air- floating above the boys, before the boys say 'shoe-rreal'.\n    While not as funny explained, the stupid pun on the words shoe and surreal is perfectly on brand for this mangas stupid gags, and its dumb puns and slapstick never fail to make me laugh.\n\n    Bonus chapters that don't feel forced in, and are actually really funny.\n    This series does exactly what any series should do in utilising it's bonus chapters. They follow a side plot that doesn't feel crammed in, and are on par quality wise with the main chapters. These bonuses mainly consist of the side story 'High School Girls are Funky', and while sounding like a Lidl version of Nichijou, it maintains it's own identity and compliments the main story perfectly. It's a roughly 20 chapter or so story focusing on the over the top and comedic lives of highschool girls, rather than the boys. It often plays on how grudge-holdy and territorial girls are stereotyped to be, but in a more light hearted and funny way. This all culminates in a funny yet satisfying end to this 20 chapter sub plot in 94.5, not going on for too long but still making me chuckle every time.\n\n    Conclusion\n    'The Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys' is a manga that anyone with a sense of humour can pick up and read, and laugh at at least something. Wether you laugh at the funny reaction faces, the dumb puns, or the well portrayed slapstick, there's something here for everyone. This kept my monkey brain well entertained and laughing for it's duration, and is the 2nd best comedy manga i've ever read, just behind 'Grand Blue Dreaming'- This is a lot more easily accessible than 'Grand Blue Dreaming', however. It is incredibly funny and one of the most entertaining manga's i've ever had in a manga. It's something anyone can and should read and enjoy, and is easily one of my favourite comedies, as well as being one of my favourite mangas overall. There's not a thing I'd change for the world.\n<\/pre><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idReview<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"3\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['idReview']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>date<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (12) \"Aug 09, 2020\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['date']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>likes<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"0\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[3]['likes']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt class=\"kint-parent\"><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><span class=\"kint-popup-trigger\" title=\"Open in new window\">&boxbox;<\/span><nav><\/nav><dfn>4<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>array<\/var> (11)<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]<\/div><\/dt><dd><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idUser<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"2\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['idUser']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>username<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (4) \"iPig\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['username']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>profilePic<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (12) \"ipig_pfp.png\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['profilePic']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>engagement<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (3) \"275\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['engagement']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idAnime<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (2) \"13\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['idAnime']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>nameJap<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (5) \"K-On!\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['nameJap']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>banner<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (15) \"k-on_banner.jpg\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['banner']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt class=\"kint-parent\"><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><span class=\"kint-popup-trigger\" title=\"Open in new window\">&boxbox;<\/span><nav><\/nav><dfn>content<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>UTF-8 string<\/var> (3631) \"First of all, it is a series that only lovers of the moe genre will like, or...<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['content']<\/div><\/dt><dd><pre>First of all, it is a series that only lovers of the moe genre will like, or in any case those of comedy or even music (not excessive), if you do not meet any of the three requirements you probably do not like this series.\n    To me it seems a series very well planned, at the same time that predictable. Girls addicted to music who try to refloat a school club, attracting new members to form a band. This is how Yui, is incorporated in the first chapter and begins the story of the Houkago Tea Time! (which is the name of the band, whose meaning in Japanese is Tea after class).\n\n    The five members of the band, who are in turn the protagonists of the series, have totally different personalities and roles, creating a fully compensated story, without forgetting the moe touch, which is all the characteristics among each other.\n\n    On the one hand Ritsu, the drummer, is the president of the club and the most savvy of the five, but likewise it is the most vague and many times they have had the odd problem for it. She is also the most temperamental and easily gets to take out Mio.\n\n    Mugi, is the keyboard player, comes from a well-heeled and well-known family, but she flees from the clich&#233;s and behaves like a normal girl of her age, without affecting this to her character. Also, although of the feeling of being shy, it often surprises with extroverted attitudes. It is the largest supplier of pastries of the group, and who is usually responsible for making tea.\n\n    Mio is the authentic idol of all of them. She is the most popular girl in the institute and she even has a fan club. She is a friend of Ritsu's childhood and an excellent bass player. All her fame and modesty gives her enough cut because she is very shy and above all scary, she panics practically of anything. She is also a vocalist, although it is Yui who most plays this role.\n\n    Yui, the face of the band, is literally a piece of bread. It is super naive and adorable, and is the maximum exponent of the genus moe in this series. Achuchable and clumsy as you can not, it is impossible not to squirm with the amount of small misfortunes that happen. She is totally dependent on his sister Ui, and is not able to do any domestic chores without breaking something. On the contrary, he has an innate talent for music, getting to learn at a speed to play the guitar and even to tune it by itself.\n\n    Later they are joined by Azusa, the last member of the group, who is one year younger than them, and is a classmate of Ui, Yui's sister. Azusa is very shy and joins the club after they looked desperately for a new member, since it really took 5 to have a club. Azusa joins the same and is received with open arms by all, especially by Yui, who constantly compares her to a cat, calling her Azu-nyan to the point of putting out little ears of cat and forcing her to meow, saying that it sounds very heavy but Seeing it is hilarious.\n    Then as secondary characters we will highlight Sawako Yamanaka, called by the girls Sawa-chan, who is her teacher and also one of the former members of the light music club, although in her time she was part of a metal band ^^. It is his main support and advice throughout the series.\n    The series although it is very slow pace is very easy to see, thanks to the ease of the script and the large number of funny points it has. It's totally adorable and lovable! The protagonists do not take long to show their personality and manias, which, even though they are very different from each other, cohere perfectly with each other, this being an essential point for you to end up identifying with one of them.\n<\/pre><\/dd><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>idReview<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"4\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['idReview']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>date<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (12) \"Sep 14, 2018\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['date']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><dl><dt><span class=\"kint-access-path-trigger\" title=\"Show access path\">&rlarr;<\/span><dfn>likes<\/dfn> =&gt; <var>string<\/var> (1) \"0\"<div class=\"access-path\">$value[4]['likes']<\/div><\/dt><\/dl><\/dd><\/dl><\/li><\/ul><\/dd><\/dl><\/div>","currentUserLikes":"<div class=\"kint-rich\"><dl><dt><dfn>$value<\/dfn> <var>array<\/var> (0)<\/dt><\/dl><\/div>"}},"session":{"__ci_last_regenerate":"<pre>1653379767<\/pre>"},"headers":{"Host":"localhost","Connection":"keep-alive","Sec-Ch-Ua":"&quot; Not A;Brand&quot;;v=&quot;99&quot;, &quot;Chromium&quot;;v=&quot;101&quot;, &quot;Google Chrome&quot;;v=&quot;101&quot;","Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile":"?0","Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform":"&quot;Windows&quot;","Upgrade-Insecure-Requests":"1","User-Agent":"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/101.0.4951.67 Safari\/537.36","Accept":"text\/html,application\/xhtml+xml,application\/xml;q=0.9,image\/avif,image\/webp,image\/apng,*\/*;q=0.8,application\/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9","Sec-Fetch-Site":"same-origin","Sec-Fetch-Mode":"navigate","Sec-Fetch-User":"?1","Sec-Fetch-Dest":"document","Referer":"http:\/\/localhost\/animelette\/public\/Home\/logout","Accept-Encoding":"gzip, deflate, br","Accept-Language":"es-ES,es;q=0.9,en;q=0.8,ja;q=0.7,ca;q=0.6","Cookie":"debug-bar-tab=ci-database; debug-bar-state=minimized"},"cookies":{"debug-bar-tab":"ci-database","debug-bar-state":"minimized"},"request":"HTTP\/1.1","response":{"statusCode":200,"reason":"OK","contentType":"text\/html; charset=UTF-8"}},"config":{"ciVersion":"4.1.9","phpVersion":"7.4.26","phpSAPI":"apache2handler","environment":"development","baseURL":"http:\/\/localhost\/animelette\/public\/","timezone":"America\/Chicago","locale":"en","cspEnabled":false}}
